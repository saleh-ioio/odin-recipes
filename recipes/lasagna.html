    <h1>lasagna</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish consisting of layers of wide,
        flat pasta sheets alternated with a rich tomato-based sauce infused
        with herbs and sautéed onions and garlic. Creamy ricotta cheese adds
        a luscious touch, while additional ingredients like sautéed vegetables
        or meat provide depth of flavor. Baked to perfection, the result is
        a mouthwatering combination of tender pasta, flavorful sauce,
        and gooey melted cheese—a comforting and satisfying dish enjoyed
        on special occasions or as a hearty main course.</p>

        <li>Onion (1 medium-sized, finely chopped)</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves (2-3 cloves, minced)</li>
        <li>Dried oregano (1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>

    <h3>Steps to make lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the temperature indicated on the lasagna noodle package instructions.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and
            sauté until they become fragrant and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until browned and fully cooked through. Break
            up any large chunks of meat with a spatula or spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato sauce and add the dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine and let the
            sauce simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with a pinch of salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer
            of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of the meat sauce and dollops of the ricotta cheese
            mixture. Sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese over the ricotta layer. Repeat
            the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until the
            cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese on top is golden and
            slightly crispy.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove from the oven and let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. This allows the
            layers to settle and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
    </ol>
